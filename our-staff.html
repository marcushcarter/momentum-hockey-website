        <p>Growing up in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Drake’s passion for hockey was born on the ice with the Dartmouth Whalers. After pursuing a Sport Management degree at Brock University, Drake transitioned into a career dedicated to helping the next generation succeed. Now based in Ontario, Drake has gained valuable experience as a scout, coach, and recruiter, using both traditional insight and advanced analytics to uncover opportunities for players. His work with the U16 Halton Hurricanes — 2025 OMHA Champions — highlights his commitment to excellence. Drake's mission is clear: to open new doors for players by using data-driven strategies to match talent with opportunity — helping dreams become reality.</p>
