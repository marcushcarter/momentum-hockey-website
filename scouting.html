                <span class="margined">"One of the best remaining defenseman for the 2025 OHL U18 Draft, Upper Canada Cyclones' Case Hennessy has been on fire this season. His dominance from the blue line was one of the biggest reasons for UCCs success, where he was able to contribute at an elite level offensively to push his team over the top!</span>
                <span class="margined">2025 OHL U18 Draft prospect Case Hennessy is a mobile, right-shot defenseman with elite playmaking instincts. He tallied 50 points in 53 games (13G, 37A), showing his ability to drive offense from the blue line. With 147 puck recoveries and 308 slapshots, Hennesy creates second chances and ititiates transition with precision. His vision, puck patience, and high-tempo decisions make him an OHL-ready playmaker who can quarterback a power play and contribute in all three zones."</span>

                <span class="margined">"Just an amazing instigator, Brodie Pithie has made a name for himself for being hard to play against, and hard to tune out. He plays a great two way game, with solid physicality and scoring ability, making him hard to contain, and even harder to keep from getting under your skin.</span>
                <span class="margined">I first started coaching Brodie during the summer of his U13 year. Like most, Brodie would improve every time I saw him, but it was always more noticable how much better he was. Well liked on the bench and in the room, I always figured if my spring teams has a captain, he'd be top of the list, always doing as asked, and never taking a shift off.</span>
                <span class="margined">Serving as the top player in Okanagan's second season with the 09s, Brodie Pithie is a dominant two-way forward with all the makings to have a power-forward type of style as he gets older. He has a mean streak and will dish hits and excels at getting under his opponents' skin. This habit has proven to be very effective, as he can typically divert attention away from the play and draw penalties from his annoyed opponents. He has a heavy shot and can score in bunches if left alone on open ice. He has transitioned to being more of a centerman but has had a lot of success in the past as a right winger as well. He is going to be an interesting player to watch, and with the right development, could be a legitimate junior player."</span>

            <span class="margined">One of the biggest pests in the class, Waterloo's Michael Pope has been a thorn in the side of many players over the course of the year. With a massive physical edge, Pope has found his niche by getting under opponents' skin, drawing penalties and putting his team on the power play. Pope has great speed, and uses it to drive along the ing and towards the net, where his quick shot allows him to beat goalies on the rush. His physical game is very strong, he hits heavily and doesn't hesitate to finish his checks. Additionally, he has a good level of skill to compliment his physical side, with very solid hands and puck-handling abilities.</span>

With good skill across the board, and a strong defensive ability, Seminara can be relied upon in all situations. Despite Guelphs position in the standings, the team did some real damage in the playoffs, taking power houses like Oakville and Halton to the ropes, and Seminara was a key part of this. With a high work ethic, he is poised to take the next step in his young career.</span>
            <span class="margined">Seminara has been a very fun player to watch on Guelph this year. Despite the team finishin towards the bottom of the standing, Seminara continued to play hard in every game he played, no matter the score. He is a very versatile two-way centerman who does well in faceoffs and possesses a strong defensive IQ. He has a nice shot, and great playmaking abilities, ehich make him a dual threat. He is a very skilled, dynamic skater with great speed, allowing him to outpace his opponents. Has a sneaky physical side, and can catch his opponents by surprise."</span>

            <span class="margined">I worked with Ben last year on a championship winning team, where he went all tournament without being on the ice for a goal against. His defensive presence was incredibly important to our squad, and he helped us hold the fort down in high offensive games. He has already gotten some reps in the GOJHL, where he looked right at home, mentally and physically- experience that will prove t be invaluable as he looks to make the jump on a full time basis.</span>
            <span class="margined">He's a big physical, defensive defenseman with a whole lot to offer at the next level. Combining a great skating ability eith a large frame, Markham Majors defenseman Ben Randall has become a player to watch in the GTHL, largely thanks to his impressive physical game. With his size and strength, Ben is able to beat down his opponents with ease, removing them from the game and forcing them to the outside. He has a high IQ, and is always in the right place to recieve a puck, and possesses great ability to predict the play and make himself an option. His skating is excellent for his size, which allows him to keep up. With a short sting up in the GOJHL, Ben has found his groove already at the next level, and seems to be more at home there than in AAA. This is a great sign for his development as he continues to push towards the OHL."</span>

Carter's 52% faceoff win rate, 116 puck retrievals, 146 slapshots, and 37 wrist shots demonstrate his offensive volume and puck pursuit. His strengths- high compete level, forecheck intensity, and quick decision-making- will translate well to the OHL.

              <span class="margined">With the new agreement between the CHL and NCAA, we should start seeing a lot of top Americans rising in the OHL draft! It is a very exciting time to be a AAA scout, becasue it presented a whole new cast of players that may have been overlooked before!</span>
              <span class="margined">Introducing Little Caesars #77, Kage Flory. Kage was the top dog in Buffalo last season before moving to Detroit, where he is again showing why he is one of the top defenseman in this class thanks to his mix of an old and new style of game, with crushing hits and swift skating.</span>
              <span class="margined">"He's one of the best American 09 defenseman this season. Stylistically, he brings together elements that help him emulate a style of play similar to a high-end puck-moving defenseman, with a physical edge that helps him compare to an older generation of player. He has a relatively large frame, which he uses to protect the puck and outmuscle his opponents, as well as deliver crushing open-ice hits. He is a beatuiful skater who can join the rush well and provide a strong mobile quarterback for any offensive unit. He possesses a heavy shot, which can get through traffic, and an overall great hockey IQ, which allows him to make the right plays both offensively and defensively."</span>
              <strong class="margined"> - Head Scout Drake White</strong>
              <span class="margined">Keep an eye out for Kage as he enters the draft, as his stock could be rising, especially after a strong performance at the Silver Stick!</span>
