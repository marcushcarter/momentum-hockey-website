                <strong class="margined">Scouting Report - Brodie Pithie</strong>
                <span class="margined">"Just an amazing instigator, Brodie Pithie has made a name for himself for being hard to play against, and hard to tune out. He plays a great two way game, with solid physicality and scoring ability, making him hard to contain, and even harder to keep from getting under your skin.</span>
                <span class="margined">I first started coaching Brodie during the summer of his U13 year. Like most, Brodie would improve every time I saw him, but it was always more noticable how much better he was. Well liked on the bench and in the room, I always figured if my spring teams has a captain, he'd be top of the list, always doing as asked, and never taking a shift off.</span>
                <span class="margined">Serving as the top player in Okanagan's second season with the 09s, Brodie Pithie is a dominant two-way forward with all the makings to have a power-forward type of style as he gets older. He has a mean streak and will dish hits and excels at getting under his opponents' skin. This habit has proven to be very effective, as he can typically divert attention away from the play and draw penalties from his annoyed opponents. He has a heavy shot and can score in bunches if left alone on open ice. He has transitioned to being more of a centerman but has had a lot of success in the past as a right winger as well. He is going to be an interesting player to watch, and with the right development, could be a legitimate junior player."</span>

            <span class="margined">"A great player with a fantastic physical edge, Michael Pope excels at getting under his opponents skin, and driving the play hard. He brings the right mentality to every game, showing up and playing with a purpose, finishing his checks and getting shots off- the makings of a proper power forward</span>
            <span class="margined">One of the biggest pests in the class, Waterloo's Michael Pope has been a thorn in the side of many players over the course of the year. With a massive physical edge, Pope has found his niche by getting under opponents' skin, drawing penalties and putting his team on the power play. Pope has great speed, and uses it to drive along the ing and towards the net, where his quick shot allows him to beat goalies on the rush. His physical gam is very strong, he hits heavily and doesn't hesitate to finish his checks. Additionally, he has a good level of kill to compliment his physical side, with very solid hands and puck-handling abilities.</span>

With good skill across the board, and a strong defensive ability, Seminara can be relied upon in all situations. Despite Guelphs position in the standings, the team did some real damage in the playoffs, taking power houses like Oakville and Halton to the ropes, and Seminara was a key part of this. With a high work ethic, he is poised to take the next step in his young career.</span>
            <span class="margined">Seminara has been a very fun player to watch on Guelph this year. Despite the team finishin towards the bottom of the standing, Seminara continued to play hard in every game he played, no matter the score. He is a very versatile two-way centerman who does well in faceoffs and possesses a strong defensive IQ. He has a nice shot, and great playmaking abilities, ehich make him a dual threat. He is a very skilled, dynamic skater with great speed, allowing him to outpace his opponents. Has a sneaky physical side, and can catch his opponents by surprise."</span>

Stylistically, he brings together elements that help him emulate a style of play similar to a high-end puck-moving defenseman, with a physical edge that helps him compare to an older generation of player. He has a relatively large frame, which he uses to protect the puck and outmuscle his opponents, as well as deliver crushing open-ice hits. He is a beatuiful skater who can join the rush well and provide a strong mobile quarterback for any offensive unit.
